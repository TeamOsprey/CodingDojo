# Coding Dojo Meeting Notes

## 2024-06-11
- Participants: Nir , Mark P, Saeed
- We decided to work on a new exercise: [Fizz Buzz Plus](https://cyber-dojo.org/kata/edit/fRZ2ZZ)
- We didn't finish it but we got close
- What went well:
  - Nir is happy with the experience. He sees a benefit in explaining what he is thinking about to the driver. To him this is similar to when you teach some one and you learn from it yourself.
  - Mark pointed out how following TDD incremental steps helps to avoid complex code.
- Next session we will decide to finish this exercise, start a new one, or continue the one from past session.
